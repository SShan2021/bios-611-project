  "description": "The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Center for Health Care Quality, Licensing and Certification (L&C) Program licenses and certifies more than 30 types of healthcare facilities. The Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) is a CDPH data system created to manage state licensing-related data and enforcement actions.\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides a California healthcare facilities interdepartmental crosswalk using the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) assigned licensed facility identification numbers linked with matched California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Licensing and Certification facility lists based on license number housed in the Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) and/or the CMS Certification Number (CCN) from the Federal Automated Survey Process Environment (ASPEN) databases. This is not a comprehensive matched list, facility identification numbers that did not match are also included from both the HCAI and CDPH lists. Facility Status or Facility Level designations may explain some HCAI non-matches, for additional information contact HCAI directly. Please contact CDPH directly for more information regarding un-matched facility identifiers that do not have corresponding OSHPD identifiers.",
